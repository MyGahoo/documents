## Pricing

Currently, MyGahoo Pro supports payment via Ko-fi. The price for MyGahoo Pro is €12. This is an one-time payment. And each payment code is tied to a specific device, so if you are using multiple Edge devices or have changed new Edge devices, you will need to make a new purchase for each device. 

But updating or re-installing datafield will not change the activation code. When uninstall & install datafield, the activation status will be cleaned, but you can use the same activation code. So please keep your activation code or email safe. 

In case you lose your activation code or email after successful payment, please contact me via [richard.ciq.feedback@gmail.com](richard.ciq.feedback@gmail.com)
