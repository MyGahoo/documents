### **35. W'Balance<sup>*</sup>**
Displays W'Balance (W prime balance) for the current activity. This needs to pre-define CP (critical power) and W' (W Prime) to work. For scientific explainations, there will be plenty of article or videos to explain what it is. 

During activity, this field can be green or red. When in green, it means your current power is under CP, in other words, you are 'recovering'. Vice versa, when in red, it means you are consuming.

The current mathematical model is using differential model from Froncioni / Clarke:


`W′bal = W′bal + (CP - P) * (W′ - W′bal) / W′` when `P > CP`

`W′bal = W′bal + (CP - P)` when `P < CP`

## **VIII Environmental Information**
### **47. Clock**
Displays current time.
<br>

<span style="font-size: 0.7em; color: gray;">*Garmin official does not provide data interface, so calculated data may have inaccuracy or errors</span>
<br>
<br>

#### Wind Speed Units
- m/s: meters per second
- KPH: kilometers per hour
- MPH: miles per hour
- Beaufort scale: wind force scale, 0~12 levels

#### Wind Speed Level
Wind speed level is indicated by the number of arrows, with different numbers corresponding to wind speed as shown in the figure below. When the selected wind speed unit is not m/s, the arrow number will still be calculated based on the correct wind speed rather than the displayed number.
<br>
![wind speed](images/wd_speed.jpg)

#### Absolute/Relative Wind Direction
- Absolute Direction: Wind direction given in weather forecast, irrelevant to riding direction
- Relative Direction: The relative angle between current riding direction and wind direction. For example, if going west with absolute wind direction from north to south, the relative wind direction is from right to left.

#### Wind Direction Colors
When displaying relative wind direction, arrows are colored based on wind angle. Red indicates headwind (relative wind from 45° left front to 45° right front); green indicates tailwind (relative wind from 45° left rear to 45° right rear); black indicates crosswind.
<br>
![wind direction](images/wd_dir.jpg)
<br>

#### Configuration
The wind module needs to be configured in the ConnectIQ app for optimal display. Please refer to the [Weather Configuration](en/weather.md) module for details.

## **IX Virtual LED**
Virtual LEDs can be configured around the screen edges. Users can use LEDs in different positions to display different information.
<br>
![led example](images/led.jpg)

### Real-time Power
Virtual LEDs display the quantity and color for each Zone (color style set to Garmin style in example below)
<br>
![power led](images/pw_led.jpg)

### 3s Average Power
Same as above.

### Heart Rate Zones
Virtual LEDs display the quantity and color for each Zone (color style set to Garmin style in example below)
<br>
![hr led](images/hr_led.jpg)

### Average Speed Indicator
Virtual LEDs display the relationship between current speed and average speed, with red indicating falling behind (less than average) and blue indicating leading (greater than average).
<br>
![led avg](images/led_avg.jpg)
<br>
Each LED represents a 10% lead or lag, as shown in the table below. The table uses leading as an example; lagging follows the same principle.

| Example | Meaning |
|:----:|:----------:|
| ![led_avg_b0](images/led_avg_b0.jpg) | Equal to average speed |
| ![led_avg_b1](images/led_avg_b1.jpg) | Current lead < 10% |
| ![led_avg_b2](images/led_avg_b2.jpg) | 10% < Current lead < 20% |
| ![led_avg_b3](images/led_avg_b3.jpg) | Current lead > 20% |

### Average Power Indicator
Virtual LEDs display the relationship between current power and average power, with colors meaning the same as above, but each LED represents a 20% lead or lag. The table uses leading as an example; lagging follows the same principle.

| Example | Meaning |
|:----:|:----------:|
| ![led_avg_b0](images/led_avg_b0.jpg) | Equal to average power |
| ![led_avg_b1](images/led_avg_b1.jpg) | Current lead < 20% |
| ![led_avg_b2](images/led_avg_b2.jpg) | 20% < Current lead < 40% |
| ![led_avg_b3](images/led_avg_b3.jpg) | Current lead > 40% |

### Left-Right Balance Indicator
Virtual LEDs display the left-right balance of current pedaling power. Each LED represents a 5% offset for one side. The table uses right-shifted pedaling as an example; the opposite follows the same principle.

Additionally, if the received left-right balance values are 100-0 or 0-100, an error state will be displayed. This situation usually occurs due to disconnection of one side of the dual-sided power meter or momentary force during first pedaling.

| Example | L - R |
|----|----------|
| ![lr_01](images/lr_01.jpg) | 50% - 50% |
| ![lr_02](images/lr_02.jpg) | 45~50% - 50~55% (not including 55%) |
| ![lr_03](images/lr_03.jpg) | 40~45% - 55~60% (not including 60%) |
| ![lr_04](images/lr_04.jpg) | ≤40% - ≥60% |
| ![lr_err](images/lr_err.jpg) | 0%-100% (or 100%-0%) |


### 3s Left-Right Balance Indicator
Same as above.
