# Weather Configuration
This section explains how to configure weather settings in the ConnectIQ app to display correct data in the wind module.

## Device Compatibility
The wind module's data source has 3 states: Internet updated, using Garmin's built-in weather information, and no data. Due to different support for different APIs in new and old devices (this is a limitation from Garmin), different devices can support some or all of the modes. For older devices, the OpenWeather API is available (since V2.2.0) but will be updated in a lower frequency. See the table below for support details.

| Icon | Meaning | Update Frequency | Location Precision | Supported Devices |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| ðŸŸ¢ | Successfully updated through OpenWeather | - Every minute (x40 / x50 / explorer2) <br> - Every 5 minute (x20 / x30 / explorer1) | Weather information at current latitude and longitude | ALL |
| â­• | OpenWeather update failed, using Garmin built-in weather data | Uncertain, determined by Garmin | Weather information from nearest airport or weather station | 530 / 830 / 1030 and newer models |
| ðŸ”´ | Unable to obtain any data | - | - | ALL |

!!! info "Pre-requisite for ðŸŸ¢"
    There are several conditions to be met before you can see green dot:

    - API key itself can work properly (you've verified your email in Open Weather etc.)
    - API key is saved in CIQ setting
    - Latitude and longitude are obtained (so indoor environment is likely to fail)
    - Mobile phone is connected and able to connect to Internet (as long as phone is nearby and has signal, this should be fine)
