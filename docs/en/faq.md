# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. The datafield is updated, but in ConnectIQ, it still shows 'old version' setting page
It has been reported as a Garmin bug since 7 YEARS ago, but it's still there. I can do nothing about it. Usually this problem will disapper in 1~2 days as new setting page is updated in ConnectIQ.

Some also says using GarminExpress on computer to update IQ app can solve this, but it's not verified.


## 2. Click 'update' in ConnectIQ, then it shows queue starts / update starts, yet install didn't succeed at last.
This installation failure is usually caused by Garmin servers. You can try:

    a) Use a VPN to download the latest version of the Garmin ConnectIQ app

    b) Restart your Garmin Edge device and try installing again

## 3. The setting page doesn't show payment code, and version code shows as 0.0.0
Please make sure you have added MyGahoo Pro on Garmin Edge first, and try to open Connect IQ setting page again.

## 4. After first install, the app crashed and shows CIQ icon
Please restart Edge device, the crash issue is now under fixing.
